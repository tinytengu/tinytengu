Sup! **tinytengu** (not that tiny actually) here and I'm a software developer!

I'm 19 and I've been a developer for 4 years now and here's my skills

### Languages
`Python, Go, C, C# (w/ WPF), C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Dart, Ruby, Pawn`

A Swiss knife man, indeed. I use some of them quite rarely and don't really pretend to be **highly** qualified, but if they're necessary for the task, then there will be no problemo ðŸ—¿

My main languages are `Python, Go, C#, Dart and JavaScript`

### Databases
`MongoDB, MySQL / MariaDB, PostreSQL (WIP), SQLite, Redis (WIP)`

### Some hype frameworks
I usually spend a lot of extra time writing my own frameworks and stuff, but I've bothered to learn these ones:

`Flask, Django (WIP), Vue.js, Flutter`

### And some great and useful things
`Git, Nginx, Docker (+ docker-compose), Kubernetes, Gunicorn, uWSGI`

Not so bad for 4 years, is it?
